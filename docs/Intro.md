# Crysol Documentation

## What are `vmed` functions?

Traditionally, Solidity has been primarily used for verifying cryptographic
objects and rarely for creating them, eg we verify ECDSA signatures in Solidity
via `ecrecover` and create them via our non-Solidity based wallet libraries.

`crysol` takes a more comprehensive approach and also provides functionality to
create cryptographic objects, allowing developers to test and research
cryptographic systems in a pure EVM environment.

However, most Solidity code is run on public blockchains - the last place one
should perform operations requiring a secret key as input.

To ensure operations using sensitive data are never run on non-local blockchains
such functions are "`vmed`", meaning they revert whenever the chain id is not `31337`.


## The Prelude

Many libraries include a code block called _prelude_ providing common internal
functionality such as the `vmed` modifier which protects certain functions from
being called in non-local environments.

The _prelude_ code is:

```solidity
// ~~~~~~~ Prelude ~~~~~~~
// forgefmt: disable-start
Vm private constant vm = Vm(address(uint160(uint(keccak256("hevm cheat code")))));
modifier vmed() {
    if (block.chainid != 31337) revert("requireVm");
    _;
}
// forgefmt: disable-end
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```
